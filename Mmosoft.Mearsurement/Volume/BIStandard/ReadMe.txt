Imperial units
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units

The system of imperial units or the imperial system (also known as British Imperial[1] or Exchequer Standards of 1825) 
is the system of units first defined in the British Weights and Measures Act of 1824, which was later refined and reduced. 
The Imperial units replaced the Winchester Standards, which were in effect from 1588 to 1825.[2] The system came into official 
use across the British Empire. By the late 20th century, most nations of the former empire had officially adopted the metric 
system as their main system of measurement, although some imperial units are still used in the United Kingdom, Canada and other 
countries formerly part of the British Empire. The imperial system developed from what were first known as English units, as did 
the related system of United States customary units.
